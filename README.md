# Virtual Candid Interactions — Team 11

This repository contains Prototypes #2 and #3 of Team 11’s **Virtual Candid Interactions** project for the Human-Computer Interaction course with Professor Brian Smith at Columbia University. These prototypes build on top of the [HCI Project Testbed](https://github.com/21go/hci-testbed), originally developed by [Ankur Tyagi](https://theankurtyagi.com/) using the Stream API for networking.

## Prototype #2: _Smart Share — Sharing Wheel_

**Smart Share** is a video conferencing system where users configure what information to share based on meeting type. This prototype explores the **sharing control** and **identifiability** dimensions of our design space.

### Key Features
- Users can predefine different visibility settings for meetings such as 1-on-1, class, or group calls.
- Users can fine-tune their sharing preferences right before entering a meeting.
- Toggle options like full-camera blur and voice distortion give users dynamic control over how they present themselves.

## Prototype #3: _PlayBack — Retroactive Lecture Interactions_

**PlayBack** shifts candid virtual interaction to an asynchronous setting. Instead of live meetings, users engage with pre-recorded videos and interact through timestamped comments.

### Key Features
- Users leave comments during playback, which are emailed to the video’s author with a timestamp for context.
- All users can view and reply to comments, enabling threaded discussion tied to specific video moments.
- Comments can be posted anonymously to foster more open participation.
